### Hi, I’m Prital Bamnodkar 👋

I am an AI/ML Researcher and Developer, specializing in building robust, reliable, and adaptive learning systems. My work bridges the gap between foundational research and practical, end-to-end system implementation.

#### 🔭 Featured Research: Continual Learning Systems

My core research focuses on **Continual Learning** to solve the challenge of "catastrophic forgetting" in neural networks.

- 📜 **Preprint:** My solo-author paper, **[Task-Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21109)**, introduces a novel, cognitively-inspired algorithm for enforcing representational stability in dynamic environments.
- 💻 **Implementation:** The project, including all experiments and benchmarks, was built in **PyTorch**. The full codebase is available here: **[github.com/pritalb/tfc-sr](https://github.com/pritalb/tfc-sr)**

#### 🌱 Current Focus: Distributed AI & Agentic Systems

I am currently designing and prototyping a new architecture for distributed continual learning, **"Prototypal Broadcast Networks,"** aimed at enabling collective intelligence in multi-agent systems.
